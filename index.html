        <h4>The Jordanian Food</h4>
        <img scr="https://cdn.theculturetrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/jordanian-mansaf-topped-with-herbs-650x458.jpg" width="400" height="200">
        <P>Jordan’s most famous traditional dish and a nationally celebrated pride is mansaf. It is enlightening to know that Jordanians go back to solid Bedouin roots, from which the concept of mansaf has seen life. The very fatty dish consists of rice stirred with heavy domestic margarine, cooked separately from the thick yogurt essence, and is stirred until boiled. Big lumps of meat are added to the yogurt to cook until it’s well-done. Bedouins would use camel or sheep meat, but nowadays, some use calf meat, and others substitute it with chicken, but Jordanians would make teasing jokes about the later, for as the famous Jordanian saying goes: “Chicken mansaf won’t satisfy a true Jordanian.”</P>

        <h4>The Yemeni Food</h4>

        <p>“It is a special Yemeni red chilli, and it is not too spicy, but has a very unique hotness to it, and you can’t make it with other chillies you find here,” Akeel says. “Another special red-chilli paste is used for marinating fish and cooking. Different regions of Yemen have different national dishes.”

Perhaps the best-known ­Yemeni dish is mandi, made of basmati or Indian rice, slow-stewed meat, and spices.

Originating in the southern city of Hadramaut, mandi’s name comes from the word “nada” (dew) referring to the “dewy” texture of the meat.

“What makes the dish extra delicious is when you eat it with your hand,” says Akeel. “It is usually made as a large dish so it can be shared and bring people ­together.”
